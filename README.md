# SwarmRobotics-Simulation

Master Goal:
Attempting to build a simulation for Swarm robotics using Turtle library in Python

Sub goals:
1.	Individual robots follow each other 
2.	All the bots search for an object and converge on it when found
3.	Bots form a shape

Steps:
1.	Create the environment 
2.	Create bots
3.	Create movement logic for the bots
4.	Create proximity and orientation algorithms
